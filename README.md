# ComputeReallySoftly

## Overview
---
This repository serves as a collection of bio-inspired soft computing alogrithms' general implementations in C.

The algorithms covered are to be:
	1. Differential Evolution
	2. Genetic Algorithm*
	3. Particle Swarm Optimisation*
	4. Spider Monkey Optimisation*
	5. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm*

The repository also contains various sample problems and instructions on how to write your own problems.

_Algorithms with * have yet to be done_
